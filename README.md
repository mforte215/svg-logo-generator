The SVG Logo Generator is a command line javascript program that can be run with node in the terminal. It prompts the user with a series of questions regarding the input for a custom SVG Logo. The Logo consist of 4 aspects; the shape of the logo, the color of the shape of the logo, the three-letter text of the logo, and the color of the three-letter text of the logo. When the prompt questions are completed, the new SVG file will be created in the examples folder. Subsequent logos will overwrite logo.svg unless changed otherwise.
